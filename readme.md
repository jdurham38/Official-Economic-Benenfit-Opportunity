# NFC Economic Benefit Opportunity Payment System

This app emulates an NFC transaction Tag on an Android device using **Host-based Card Emulation** ("HCE").



The app is running up to Android 13 (SDK 33, the actual one when app was created) and is tested on a real 
Android device, Samsung Galaxy s20.

There are 3 main functionalities:

1) Send a message using HCE to another device in NDEF format
2) Add HCE
3) Save example transaction data
