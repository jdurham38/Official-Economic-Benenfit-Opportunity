# NFC Economic Benefit Opportunity Payment System

My team and I worked on an NFC application for our senior project. NFC (Near Field Communication) is a technology that allows two devices to communicate wirelessly when they are brought close together. Our application uses NFC to enable contactless payments and transfers of information between devices. We designed and developed the application from scratch, using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Throughout the project, we collaborated closely, sharing ideas and working together to overcome challenges. The end result was a functional and user-friendly application that we were proud to showcase as the culmination of our studies.

This app emulates an NFC transaction Tag on an Android device using **Host-based Card Emulation** ("HCE").



The app is running up to Android 13 (SDK 33, the actual one when app was created) and is tested on a real 
Android device, Samsung Galaxy s20.

There are 3 main functionalities:

1) Send a message using HCE to another device in NDEF format
2) Add HCE
3) Save example transaction data
